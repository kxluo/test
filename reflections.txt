When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-- collaborating with others, sharing code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-- control when we want to update the local files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-- forks copy a repository from others' repository; clones copy a repository from own remote or from a local repository; branches create new branches on the same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-- maybe help keep tracking of last know state of the remote, and easy to check and/or resolve conflicts if any

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

-- It is easier to collaborate using Git or GitHub, especially if the collaboration has many overlaps.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

-- making changes in a separate branch is better if we want to try a different function or experiment different features of the thing we are building. But we might prefer to use a single master branch, if we are continually improving the code.
